## ðŸ§™ Caido Graphql API Explorer

This repository contains the most up to date schema for the Caido API and the code for the [Voyager explorer](https://github.com/graphql-kit/graphql-voyager).

Visit our [documentation](https://docs.caido.io/concepts/internals/graphql.html) for more details.
Visit the the [API Explorer](https://graphql-explorer.caido.io/) to visualize the schema.

### Stability

We don't make any guarantee on the stability of the GraphQL API provided by the proxy. We often do breaking changes between versions.
On each release, we publish the schema under `src/assets/schemal.graphql` so you should be able to diff it easily.

## ðŸ’š Community

Come join our [Discord](https://links.caido.io/www-discord) community and connect with other Caido users! We'd love to have you as part of the conversation and help with any questions you may have.
